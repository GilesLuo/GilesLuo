### Greatings! This is Zhiyao (Giles)!ðŸ‘‹
- :school: My status: I'm a full-time DPhil student at University of Oxford after working as a graduate research fellow for National University of Singapore with Prof. Xiaonan Wang (https://www.smartsystemsengineering.com/). 
 
- :man_student: I received MSc Degree at National University of Singapore in 2020 on my Master Thesis "Collision-Free Multi-Agent Path Finding via Distributed Reinforcement Learning" under the supervison of Prof. Guillaume Sartoretti (https://www.marmotlab.org/). Before that, I received Bachelor degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University in China under the joint educational framework with National University of Singapore. 
 
- ðŸ”­ My interests lay in reinforcement learning, structural learning and some other branches of machine learning which correlate to the application of AI in real world. Iâ€™m currently working on the development of medical decision making systems, and some interdisplinary translational work bridging AI with Chemistry, Material Science and Multi-Energy Systems. 

- :question: You are very welcomed to contact me regarding research-wise collaboration or working/study experience.
